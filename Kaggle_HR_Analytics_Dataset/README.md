# Missing Data

Missing values occur in all kinds of datasets from industry to academia. They can be represented differently - sometimes by a question mark, or -999, sometimes by 'n/a', or by some other dedicated number or character.

Detecting and handling missing values in the correct way is important, as they can impact the result of the analysis, and there are algorithms that can't handle them.

There is no penancea for all missing value imputation problems. For example, if missing values are due to a malfunctioning of the measuring machine and therefore real numerical values are just not recorded then in that case you can't impute missing values with 0 whereas if missing values appear where there is nothing to measure then it can be imputed by 0.

Some methods of detecting missing values and of which type:
- Histograms are a great tool to find placeholder character, if any.
- Usually, for nominal data, it is easier to recognise the placeholder for missing values, since the string format allows is to write some reference to a missing value, like 'unknown' or 'n/a'.

Missing values are usually classified into three different types:
